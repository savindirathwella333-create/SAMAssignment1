## Project Description
['This project is designed to teach a 3-person development team how to collaborate effectively using Git branching workflows while building a responsive freelance portfolio website. The website includes a navigation system with a mobile hamburger menu, a hero landing section, a services showcase with card layouts, a projects and skills display, and a contact form with validation. Each team member is assigned specific responsibilities: Member 1 handles the navigation and hero section, Member 2 focuses on the services section and overall page layout with responsive styling, and Member 3 builds the projects section and contact form. The team follows a structured Git workflow where everyone branches from the develop branch, works on their features independently, commits their changes with clear messages like "feat: add responsive navigation menu", and then opens pull requests for team review before merging back into develop. This approach teaches important collaboration skills including code reviews, merge conflict resolution (which can be practiced by having Members 2 and 3 intentionally edit the same section), and version control best practices. Once all features are merged into develop, the team performs a final merge to the main branch for production, completing a full professional development cycle that mirrors real-world software engineering workflows.']
